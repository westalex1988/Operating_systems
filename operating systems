Your operating system manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time there are several different computer programs running at the same time that all need to access your computers central processing unit. Some examples of operating systems are Windows, Mac, and Chrome. 
When an application runs on Windows it goes through a system interface which in turn calls system services in the kernel(memory, drivers,screen display, etc), then the kernel calls upon the hardware to perform requested services. Windows has protected and supervisor mode, which allows the disk access and file system device drivers. Windows allows users to make changes to the operating system easier than most other operating systems. Windows is perceived to be more feature rich. 
The Mac OS is percieved to be more simple, as it does not allow alot of changes to be made to the OS itself. Mac OS come with alot more applications already installed in there software. Mac OS can only be used on certain brand devices, which are more expense then other PC's. Mac is considered to be one of the safest operating systems.
An Android OS is based on the Linux kernel long-term support branch. Its user interface is based on direct-manipulation, which means it was designed for touch screen, pretty much so it can be used on a handheld device. An Android system is what makes your phone do everything it does.
