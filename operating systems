Your operating system manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time there are several different computer programs running at the same time that all need to access your computers central processing unit. Some examples of operating systems are Windows, Mac, and Chrome. 
When an application runs on Windows it goes through a system interface which in turn calls system services in the kernel(memory, drivers,screen display, etc), then the kernel calls upon the hardware to perform requested services. Windows has protected and supervisor mode, which allows the disk access and file system device drivers. Windows allows users to make changes to the operating system easier than most other operating systmes.
